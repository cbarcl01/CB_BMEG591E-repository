## Introduction

overview of the original study, the scope of your re-analysis, and why you chose it

![Schema of phylogenetic position of Mnemiopsis leidyi](C:\Users\cbarc\OneDrive\Desktop\git_temp\CB_BMEG591E-repository\Group_Project\Mle.jpg)

## Method

integrated data processing, QC, analysis, results, graphs, and other data, as well as written explanations for what is being done and why, and interpretations of results. This should flow in chronological order (e.g. starting with fastqs and ending with the last graph).

## Results

integrated data processing, QC, analysis, results, graphs, and other data, as well as written explanations for what is being done and why, and interpretations of results. This should flow in chronological order (e.g. starting with fastqs and ending with the last graph).


## Conclusion

Summarize your findings and contrast this with what the original study found. Remark on anything surprising or anything you would do differently next time.
